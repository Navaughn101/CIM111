  I am a university of miami football player, im a cool person not much of a talker.
  I picked this class becuase i thought it will be cool. Which it is, i like to be in hands on type of classes. I feel like its better for me.
  In highschool i became  certified in Digital imagery and was trying to get my certifcation in video editing but i graduated highschool early.
  so i didn't get a chance to finish. This is something i can see myself doing later in life if i can get the concept of web lab.
  My major is crimiolgy, minor in film and sports ad.
